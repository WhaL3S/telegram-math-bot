# telegram-math-bot
This is telegram bot designed to solve basic arithmetic expressions like addition ( + ), subtraction ( - ), multiplication ( * ), division ( / ), exponentiation ( ** ), as well as using comparison ( <, >, ==, <=, >= ), trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, cosec, arsin, arccos, arctan, arccot), converting from radians to degrees and vise versa. 
Moreover, you can witness the real time working of the bot based on this code in telegram: t.me/QazMatBot.
Thank you for reading my first project!
